Complexity Analysis: T = a * n^b
============================================================

Earcut (Mapbox C++):
  T = 2.77e-05 * n^1.382
  R^2 = 0.4065
  Interpretation: Between O(n) and O(n log n)

Reflex (Ours, C++):
  T = 1.06e-04 * n^1.165
  R^2 = 0.1445
  Interpretation: Between O(n) and O(n log n)

Naive O(n^2) (Python):
  T = 2.71e-04 * n^1.908
  R^2 = 0.9946
  Interpretation: Near quadratic O(n^2)


NOTE: The 'Reflex' algorithm shows high variance across polygon types.
- Convex polygons: O(n) via fan triangulation
- Non-convex: O(n * k) where k depends on spatial distribution
- Worst case: O(n^2) for pathological inputs
